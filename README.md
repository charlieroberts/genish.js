# genish.js
A library for generating optimized, single-sample audio callbacks in JavaScript. Inspired by gen~ in Max/MSP.

## try it out
http://www.charlie-roberts.com/genish/playground

genish.js should run in all reasonably modern browsers; however, it runs best in Firefox, Edge, and Chrome due to their support for AudioWorklets. Other browsers will fallback to using a ScriptProcessor node, which runs on the main thread and thus may result in glitches.

## what?
A little more detail: genish.js will compile per-sample callback functions from a graph. Given the following code to create a sine oscillator and scale its output:

```javascript
mul( cycle( 220 ), .1 )
```

...genish will generate the following sample processing loop (reading from a wavetable) inside of an AudioWorklet node:

```javascript
for( let i = 0; i < len; ++i ) {
  var phasor2_value = memory[2]
  memory[2] += 0.004988662131519274
  if( memory[2] >= 1 ) memory[2] -= 1
  if( memory[2] < 0 ) memory[2] += 1

  var cycle4_dataIdx  = 3, 
      cycle4_phase = phasor2_value * 1024, 
      cycle4_index = cycle4_phase | 0,
      cycle4_frac  = cycle4_phase - cycle4_index,
      cycle4_base  = memory[ cycle4_dataIdx +  cycle4_index ],
      cycle4_next  = ( cycle4_index + 1 ) & (1024 - 1),
      cycle4_out   = cycle4_base + cycle4_frac * ( memory[ cycle4_dataIdx + cycle4_next ] - cycle4_base )

  var mul5 = cycle4_out * 0.1
  memory[0]  = mul5

  left[ i ] = memory[0]
}
```

## use
To use genish.js, you need to create an AudioContext and an AudioWorklet node that will run the functions genish.js creates. Genish includes a `utilities` object that provides convenience methods for these tasks. The following example performs the necessary setup and starts a sine oscillator running:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
  <script src="https://gitcdn.link/repo/charlieroberts/genish.js/master/dist/gen.lib.js"></script>
</head>

<body></body>

<script>
// wait until genish.js has loaded...
window.onload = function() {
   // optionally put all genish object in global namespace
  genish.export( window )

  // schedule our audiocontext to be created when a user
  // interacts with the page... this is required by browsers
  utilities.createContext()

  window.onclick = ()=> {
    // now our audiocontext has been created and we
    // can create an audioworklet...
    utilities.playWorklet( cycle( 330 ) ) 
  }
}
</script>
</html>
```

AudioWorklets only run if your webpage is loaded from a server; [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) is a nice way to quickly start a server running for local testing purposes. More [standalone](./examples/sine_worklet.htm) [examples](./examples/basicfm.html) are also available in the [examples directory](./examples). You can either use the prebuilt library in the `dist` folder, or use [a version served by GitCDN](https://gitcdn.link/repo/charlieroberts/genish.js/main/dist/gen.lib.js).

## develop & test
The build script is a gulpfile. With gulp installed, run `gulp js` or `gulp watch` in the top level of the repo. `gulp test` will run the testing suite (mocha).
