<!--
This file demonstrates how to create an audiocontext and audioworklet node to use with genish.js.
Most of the code consists of setup; the synthesis (a FM synthesized gong) is only six lines of code.

    This example shows how to build a simple FM synth playing a gong sound in genish.js. 
    If you open your developer's console, you should see the generated callback function.

  <script>
// need to wait for the genish.js library to be loaded...
window.onload = function() {
  // put genish functions in global namespace...
  // you certainly don't have to do this! If you don't, every genish.js
  // ugen needs to reference the genish object (so, genish.cycle, genish.mul etc.)
  genish.export( window )
  
  const baseFrequency = 80, c2m = 1.4, index = .95

  // create our oscillator for modulation
  let modulator = cycle( mul( baseFrequency, c2m ) )

  // create an envelope lasting eight seconds
  // this envelope will control both the overall amplitude
  // of the gong as well as the brightness of the timbre by
  // modulating its index property.
  const env = ad( 44, gen.samplerate * 8 )

  // scale amplitude based on index value, re-assign
  modulator = mul( modulator, mul( baseFrequency, mul( index, env ) ) )

  // create carrier oscillator and modulate frequency
  const carrier = cycle( add( baseFrequency, modulator ) )

  // make our audio context with a buffer size of 2048 samples.
  // because browsers require user interaction to trigger audio
  // this adds callback functions that will be called when the user first
  // clicks/touches/presses a key in the browser window. 
  utilities.createContext( 2048 )

  const synth = mul( carrier, env )
  
  // make worklet only the first time window is clicked
  // and trigger gong every time window is clicked
  let init = false
  window.onclick = ()=> {
    if( init === false ) {
      utilities.playWorklet( synth, 'fmsynth', true ) 
      init = true
    }
    env.trigger()
  }
